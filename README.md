This project aims to enhance the performance of a React application by implementing code splitting using React Router. 
Code splitting is a powerful feature that allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. 
This can significantly reduce the initial load time of your application, improving user experience, especially for large applications.

Objectives:
Improve the application's performance by reducing the initial load time.
Implement code splitting using dynamic imports and React Router.
Ensure a seamless user experience with lazy loading of components.
Maintainability and scalability of the codebase.

Features:

Dynamic Imports:
Use React's lazy and Suspense components to dynamically import and load components only when they are needed.

Route-based Code Splitting:
Implement code splitting at the route level to ensure that only the necessary code for each route is loaded.

Error Boundaries:
Use error boundaries to catch and handle any errors that occur during the dynamic loading of components.
